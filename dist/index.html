    <!-- first script is the core of react and the second one is react dom this is the react library for perform dom operations -->
    <!-- why there are two CDN available? because react work on mobile and web so one is core react, it will work on both mobile and web but the second one react-dom which only work in web -->

<!-- 
The react can work inside a small portion of html independently, It is not a full fledged framework
framework is a framework which comes with all loads of things 
all framework require needs to create whole app using that framework but react can work in the existing app aswelll-->
